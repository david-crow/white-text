# white-text
Contains a VBA script to hide a payload in a Word document and later write that payload to a target computer

Specifically, the script encodes a binary file as base64 and stores it in the Word document. Ideally (as the name suggests), the script would color the base64 text white to make it less obvious to would-be targets, but that wasn't necessary for my purposes
